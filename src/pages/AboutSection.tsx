        "Beyond the world of coding, I find joy in simple yet meaningful moments—sipping a warm cup of tea (or coffee!) while watching a riveting cricket match. These moments of reflection and relaxation keep me grounded as I work towards becoming the best version of myself. As a driven and enthusiastic individual, I am on a mission to not just grow as a programmer but also contribute meaningfully to the tech community and make a lasting impact wherever I go.",
